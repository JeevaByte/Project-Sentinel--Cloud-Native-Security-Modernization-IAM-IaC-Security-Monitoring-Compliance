# Project Sentinel - Architecture Diagram Prompts for Eraser

This document provides detailed prompts for creating comprehensive architecture diagrams using Eraser, a Kubernetes-native diagramming tool that can generate diagrams from YAML configurations.

## üé® Eraser Overview

Eraser is a tool that creates architecture diagrams as code, allowing you to:
- Generate consistent, version-controlled diagrams
- Automatically update diagrams when infrastructure changes
- Create multiple views (logical, physical, security, network)
- Export to various formats (PNG, SVG, PDF)

   curl -sSL https://github.com/Azure/eraser/releases/latest/download/eraser-linux-amd64.tar.gz | tar -xz
   sudo mv eraser /usr/local/bin/
   ```

2. **Create Diagram:**
   ```bash
   # Save any of the above YAML configurations to a file
   eraser create diagram.yaml
   
   # Generate PNG output
   eraser render diagram.yaml --output diagram.png
   
   # Generate SVG output
   eraser render diagram.yaml --output diagram.svg --format svg
   ```

3. **Customize for Your Environment:**
   - Modify node labels to match your specific deployment
   - Adjust colors and styles to match your organization's branding
   - Add or remove components based on your implementation

4. **Integration with CI/CD:**
   ```yaml
   # Add to GitHub Actions workflow
   - name: Generate Architecture Diagrams
     run: |
       eraser render architecture/*.yaml --output docs/diagrams/
       git add docs/diagrams/
       git commit -m "Update architecture diagrams"
   ```
